  "readme": "# connect-livereload-safe - middleware to inject livereload, safely.\n\n> Add the livereload script during development.\n\nThis is similar to\n[connect-livereload](https://github.com/intesso/connect-livereload). Only\ndifference is that this version does not modify the DOM during loading, which\nbreaks some scripts (angular-ui-router for instance).\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the module:\n\n```bash\nnpm install connect-livereload-safe --save-dev\n```\n\nAdd the middleware:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(require('connect-livereload-safe')());\n```\n\nYou can optionally specify a different host for the livereload server:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(require('connect-livereload-safe')({\n    host: 'http://localhost:35729'\n}));\n```\n\n## License \n\n    (The MIT License)\n\n    Copyright (C) 2013 by Ruben Vermeersch <ruben@savanne.be>\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
